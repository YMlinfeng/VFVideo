The video plays at normal speed. A man in a formal pinstripe suit with a black bow tie stands against a clean white backdrop, speaking with expressive openness as he turns his head gently through a deliberate sequence. The scene shows an East Asian man, likely in his late twenties to early thirties, with neatly styled brown hair and a composed yet animated demeanor. He wears a crisp white shirt beneath a dark gray pinstriped blazer, the bow tie centered and sharply tied. His mouth opens wide in clear articulation, lips moving with fluid grace as he delivers his words with calm emphasis. The background is uniformly bright and minimalist, suggesting a studio setting with soft diffused lighting that highlights his features without harsh shadows. He begins facing forward, then slowly turns his head to the right side, maintaining steady eye contact with the camera as his lips continue their rhythmic motion. His left hand rises slightly, palm facing inward, fingers lightly curled as if guiding the flow of speech. He then returns his gaze to the front, completing the turn with a subtle nod and a relaxed posture. His right hand rests near his waist, occasionally lifting just enough to accentuate a point. The entire movement is smooth and unhurried, conveying confidence and poise. The camera remains fixed at chest level, capturing his upper torso and facial expressions with clarity, emphasizing the natural rhythm of his speech and the gentle choreography of his gestures.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured figure in a pinstripe suit with a twisted black bow tie stands against a chaotic collage of grainy textures and striped patterns, lacking any clean backdrop. His facial features are grotesquely warped: teeth misaligned and crooked, deep unnatural wrinkles carved into skin, eyes sunken or mismatched, lips frozen in a rigid, unchanging shape despite attempted speech. His short brown hair is clumped and frayed, appearing digitally corrupted. Movements are erratic and spasmodic — his right hand contorts into a broken, trembling claw, fingers melting or pixelating mid-gesture, failing to articulate any point. Head turns are jerky and disjointed, losing eye contact abruptly, gaze shifting unnaturally off-frame with no smooth transition. Shoulders twitch violently, posture collapses inconsistently, breaking the rhythm of any implied speech. Lighting is harsh and uneven, casting extreme shadows and blown-out highlights, creating a garish, low-quality studio effect with visible noise and compression artifacts. Camera shakes violently, zooms erratically, and shifts framing unpredictably, capturing fragmented torso shots and distorted close-ups. Overall tone is chaotic, amateurish, and visually painful — an unrealistic 3D animation with extreme contrast, oversharpened edges, heavy grain, embedded logos, and text overlays, evoking glitch art rather than human expression.", "timestamp": "2026-01-27 14:24:24"}
