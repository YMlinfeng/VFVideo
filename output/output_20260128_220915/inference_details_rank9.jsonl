The video plays at normal speed. A young woman with wavy dark brown hair styled loosely around her shoulders sits elegantly beside a glossy black display case, wearing a strapless black gown and delicate leaf-shaped jewelry that catches the light. Her expression is poised yet expressive as she begins to speak with gentle animation, her lips moving fluidly to convey emotion without haste. She starts by turning her head fully toward the camera, facing forward with calm confidence, then smoothly shifts her gaze to the side, allowing her profile to be seen in soft silhouette against the dim background, before gracefully returning her face to the front once more. Her right hand rests lightly on the glass surface, fingers slightly curled as if brushing over an unseen object, while her left hand gently supports her chin, subtly adjusting its position as she speaks. The ambient lighting is low and warm, highlighting her features against a blurred backdrop of dark tones and faint floral patterns, suggesting an upscale indoor setting like a gallery or private event space. Her movements are unhurried and deliberate, conveying quiet charisma and thoughtful presence. The camera holds steady at eye level, capturing her upper body and nuanced gestures as she communicates with soft emphasis and composed grace.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt scene cuts. A young woman with wavy dark brown hair appears grotesquely deformed — strands are broken, clumped, or floating unnaturally, lacking volume or texture. Her face is disfigured: teeth misaligned and jagged, deep unnatural wrinkles carved across her cheeks and forehead, eyes sunken or asymmetrical, lips frozen in a rigid, incorrect shape that never moves despite attempted speech. Her skin is overly saturated with harsh contrast, appearing plastic-like with pixelated grain and artificial sharpness.\n\nShe wears a warped black strapless dress that stretches and tears at the seams, textures glitching as if rendered by low-poly 3D software. Her leaf-shaped jewelry is malformed — edges jagged, surfaces fractured, glimmer replaced by flickering noise. Her right hand is twisted, fingers contorted into impossible angles, trembling violently while scraping erratically across a glossy black surface now marred with scratches and digital artifacts. Her left arm collapses under her chin, elbow bent unnaturally, wrist snapping mid-motion, fingers twitching like broken puppets.\n\nHer head jerks abruptly between positions — forward, side, back — with no smooth transition, each turn accompanied by frame skips and motion blur. Her shoulders twitch spasmodically, posture collapsing into hunched deformity. No warmth or presence remains — only mechanical, glitched mimicry of expression.\n\nThe background is a chaotic collage of grainy static, striped patterns, and corrupted floral motifs, bleeding into each other with no depth or cohesion. The red rose with silver leaves near her fingertips is melted, pixelated, or duplicated across the frame, sometimes replaced by floating logos or unreadable text. Lighting is hyper-artificial — extreme high contrast creates blown-out highlights and crushed shadows, casting jagged halos around her form. No ambient serenity — only visual noise and aggressive sharpness.\n\nThe camera lurches unpredictably — zooms snap in and out, pans stutter sideways, tilts erratically, framing her inconsistently with half-cut limbs and skewed perspective. Composition is unstructured, often cutting off her head or hands, emphasizing the glitchy, low-quality animation style. Every movement is erratic, every detail degraded — an uncanny, broken simulation of grace, frozen in digital decay.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:33:47"}

The video plays at normal speed. A young man with soft dark hair and a gentle gaze stands against a deep black background, wearing a textured silver jacket over a black shirt. His expression is calm yet expressive as he begins to speak with quiet intensity. He first turns his head slowly to face the camera directly, then glides it smoothly toward his right side, letting his profile catch the light before returning gently to the front. His lips move with fluid, deliberate motion as he speaks, conveying emotion without urgency. His right hand lifts slightly in a relaxed gesture, fingers loosely curled, as if emphasizing a thought, while his left arm rests naturally by his side. The lighting is soft but directional, highlighting the contours of his face and the shimmer of his jacket, creating an intimate studio atmosphere. There is no rush in his movements — each turn of the head and shift of the hand feels intentional and grounded.

The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt cuts between shots. A deformed, disfigured figure with soft dark hair now appears mangled and asymmetrical, his gentle gaze replaced by vacant, misaligned eyes. His face is marred by deep, unnatural wrinkles and crooked, uneven teeth visible through a mouth frozen mid-expression — lips rigid and unchanging, failing to articulate speech. His shimmering textured jacket is rendered as pixelated, low-res fabric with glitchy artifacts, over a black top that bleeds into the background. He attempts to turn his head but the motion is violently jerky, snapping unnaturally to the right before snapping back, with no grace or flow — only mechanical spasms. His right hand twists grotesquely mid-air, fingers contorted and fragmented like broken glass, trembling violently without purpose.

The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures and striped patterns, flickering unpredictably. The camera lurches erratically, shifting framing abruptly with disjointed zooms and tilted angles, destroying any sense of composition.
