The video plays at normal speed. A man in a dark pinstripe suit stands indoors, speaking with expressive energy as he addresses the audience. He holds a microphone close to his mouth, his lips moving vividly as he articulates each word with clear emphasis. His head begins facing forward, then turns smoothly to the side as if engaging someone off-camera, before returning gently to the front, maintaining a calm and composed presence throughout. His right hand grips the microphone steadily while his left hand rests lightly on his hip, occasionally shifting in a relaxed manner to complement his speech. He has short, neatly styled dark hair and wears a black inner shirt beneath his tailored blazer. The background is a plain white wall featuring promotional text for “Gone With The Light” dated December 13, 2019. Soft, even lighting illuminates the scene, creating a professional yet approachable atmosphere typical of a press event or public appearance. His posture remains upright but not rigid, allowing subtle shifts in weight and shoulder position that enhance the natural flow of his delivery. The camera stays fixed at chest level, capturing his upper body and fluid gestures as he communicates with warmth and clarity.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt cuts between shots. A deformed, disfigured figure stands indoors — an abstract, computer-generated, unrealistic 3D animation with cartoonish, low-poly textures and no coherent human features. His face is grotesquely warped: mouth frozen mid-expression with mismatched, crooked teeth jutting out at odd angles, deep unnatural wrinkles etched across his skin like cracked porcelain. Eyes are misaligned or missing, hair rendered as jagged, static clumps. He wears a pinstripe suit that appears melted and pixelated, fabric texture broken into glitchy shards. His hands are twisted, elongated, and trembling violently — fingers fused or fragmented, microphone dissolving into digital noise as he grips it. Left hand hovers unnaturally near hip, twitching erratically without purpose. Head snaps violently left and right in jerky, non-fluid motions — no smooth eye contact, gaze vacant or glitching off-screen. Shoulders jerk unnaturally with each spasm, lacking rhythm or grace. Background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, vertical stripes, and corrupted promotional text reading “Gone With The Light” and “2019.12.13” — letters flickering, overlapping, or half-erased. Lighting is harsh and inconsistent: overexposed highlights bleach parts of his face while others drown in deep, muddy shadows; reflections appear smeared and artificial. Camera shakes violently, zooms unpredictably, and cuts abruptly mid-motion — framing constantly off-center, composition unstructured and disorienting. Entire scene suffers from extreme contrast, oversharpened edges, heavy grain, compression artifacts, and floating logos. No warmth, no confidence — only visual decay, mechanical distortion, and unnatural motion.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:33:40"}

The video plays at normal speed. A woman with dark flowing hair adorned with a heart-shaped hairpin wears a soft green blouse embellished with subtle sparkling details, standing in a softly lit indoor space with a muted blue textured wall behind her. She begins by turning her head gently to face forward, then smoothly shifts her gaze and profile toward the side, before returning gracefully to the front again. Her lips move with expressive rhythm as she speaks aloud in a clear and engaging tone, the motion of her mouth lively yet calm, conveying warmth and presence. One hand rises slowly to rest near her ear, fingers lightly brushing the earring, while the other remains relaxed at her side, occasionally lifting in a gentle gesture that matches the cadence of her speech. Her posture is poised but natural, shoulders slightly eased, as if caught mid-conversation in a quiet, intimate moment. The lighting casts soft shadows across her features, enhancing the serene atmosphere of the room, which feels like a cozy lounge or private studio. The camera holds steady at eye level, capturing her upper body and fluid movements with quiet precision, emphasizing her composed yet animated delivery.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, featuring abrupt cuts and erratic scene transitions. A woman with dark, tangled, and pixelated hair adorned with a broken, glitched heart-shaped hairpin wears a faded green blouse covered in smeared, oversaturated sparkling dots, standing in a harshly lit indoor space with flickering, uneven lighting. Her expression is僵硬 and unnatural as she speaks with no lip movement, mouth frozen in a misaligned, toothy grimace with crooked, overlapping teeth and deep, exaggerated wrinkles etched across her face. She jerks violently forward, then spasmodically whips her head to the side, revealing a warped profile with stretched features, before snapping back with a stuttering motion. Her right hand twitches uncontrollably near her ear, fingers contorted into a broken, trembling claw that hovers unnaturally against her cheekbone without touching it. The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and floating text/logos, lacking depth or coherence, suggesting a corrupted lounge or studio setting. Harsh, overexposed lighting creates extreme contrast and sharpness, amplifying digital noise, compression artifacts, and visual distortion. Her posture is rigid and disjointed, shoulders twitching erratically out of sync with any vocal rhythm. The camera stutters violently at eye level, jumping between unstable framing and unstructured compositions, capturing her upper body through fragmented, low-resolution, glitched visuals with no fluidity or warmth—only mechanical, broken motion and artificial, cartoonish degradation.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:54:30"}
