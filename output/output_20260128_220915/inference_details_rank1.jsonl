The video plays at normal speed. A man in a gray suit with a white t-shirt underneath stands on a stage with warm red lighting, speaking with expressive energy as he engages the audience. He has short dark hair neatly styled and a friendly open expression. His mouth opens wide with lively motion as he speaks, his lips moving fluidly to emphasize his words. He begins facing forward, then smoothly turns his head to the side as if addressing someone off camera, before gently returning his gaze to the front. His hands hold a small microphone with both palms cradling it lightly, fingers relaxed yet deliberate in their positioning. His posture remains upright but natural, shoulders slightly shifting with each turn of his head, conveying calm confidence. The background is softly lit with deep red tones, creating a polished event atmosphere. A faint logo appears in the upper left corner, suggesting a media or entertainment setting. The camera stays steady at chest level, capturing his upper body and subtle gestures as he communicates with warmth and presence.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt cuts between shots. A man in a gray suit with a white t-shirt underneath stands on a stage under harsh, inconsistent lighting that flickers violently between overexposed reds and deep shadows. His face is grotesquely deformed: teeth misaligned and crooked, deep unnatural wrinkles carved into his skin, mouth frozen mid-expression with no lip movement despite speaking, eyes vacant and asymmetrical. His short dark hair appears smudged and melted into his scalp. His hands are twisted, fingers broken and blurred into pixelated fragments as they clutch a microphone that shatters and reforms with each frame. His posture collapses unpredictably — shoulders lurching, spine bending unnaturally — conveying panic rather than confidence. The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, vertical stripes, and corrupted visual noise, with no coherent depth or atmosphere. A garish, glitched logo flashes erratically in the upper left corner. The camera jerks violently at chest level, cutting abruptly to extreme close-ups and wide-angle distortions, with unstructured framing and disorienting zooms. The entire scene is rendered in low-quality, hyper-sharp, oversaturated 3D animation with visible aliasing, motion blur, and digital artifacts, evoking an uncanny, broken simulation.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:33:40"}

The video plays at normal speed. A young woman wearing a white and red Olympic jacket with the Chinese flag and Paris 2024 medal around her neck stands indoors, speaking with expressive energy as she turns her head gracefully through a sequence of positions. The scene shows a young East Asian female athlete, likely in her early twenties, with long dark hair loosely falling over her shoulders. She wears a high-collared white jacket with red accents and a blue ribboned medal resting against her chest. Her mouth opens wide in a dynamic, animated manner as she speaks, lips moving fluidly to emphasize her words, conveying emotion without haste. The background features a dimly lit indoor arena with blurred spectators, suggesting a post-event moment under soft spotlighting. She begins by facing forward, then slowly turns her head to the right side, maintaining a calm and composed posture, before gently returning her gaze to the front. Her right hand lifts slightly in a relaxed gesture near her shoulder, fingers softly curled as if accompanying her speech, while her left arm remains naturally lowered. The lighting highlights her facial expressions and the texture of her jacket, creating a dignified yet personal atmosphere. The camera holds steady at eye level, smoothly capturing her upper body and subtle movements, emphasizing her poised delivery and the quiet intensity of the moment.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A young woman wearing a white and red Olympic jacket with the Chinese flag and Paris 2024 medal ribbon appears indoors but is rendered as a deformed, disfigured, computer-generated figure with no coherent facial structure — her mouth remains frozen in an unnatural pose, lips unmoving and misaligned, teeth crooked and错位, deep wrinkles etched unnaturally across her face. Her long dark hair is glitched into jagged strands or missing entirely. Her right hand is grotesquely twisted, fingers broken and pixelated, trembling violently as if corrupted by low-resolution animation. She attempts to turn her head but the motion is jerky, fragmented, and incomplete — head snaps abruptly sideways then back, eyes unblinking and fixed, gaze direction inconsistent. Her posture collapses into unnatural angles, limbs appearing disjointed. The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and floating logos, lacking any arena detail or ambient lighting — instead, harsh, flickering spotlights create extreme contrast and over-sharpened edges, casting unnatural shadows. The camera shakes violently, zooms erratically, and cuts between mismatched angles mid-motion. The entire scene is rendered in low-quality, cartoonish 3D animation with saturated colors, heavy noise, and visible compression artifacts. No emotional expression is conveyed — only mechanical, broken movement and visual distortion.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:54:31"}
