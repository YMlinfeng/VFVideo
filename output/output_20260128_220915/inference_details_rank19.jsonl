The video plays at normal speed. A man with long dark hair tied loosely back stands indoors, his expression shifting as he speaks with animated energy and expressive lip movement. He wears a traditional robe with earthy tones over a white inner garment, his posture relaxed yet engaged. The background reveals a rustic stone wall adorned with red ribbons and faded decorations, suggesting a cultural or ceremonial space. Soft ambient light illuminates his face evenly, highlighting the fluid motion of his lips as he speaks loudly but calmly, conveying emotion through subtle emphasis rather than force. His head begins facing forward, then turns gently to his right side as if addressing someone off frame, before returning smoothly to face front again. His hands move slowly in sync with his speech — one hand lifts slightly near his chest, fingers lightly curled, while the other rests along his torso, occasionally drifting upward in a gentle arc. His gaze remains steady and focused throughout, matching the rhythm of his words. The scene feels grounded and intentional, capturing a moment of quiet intensity through deliberate gestures and controlled vocal expression. The camera holds steady at eye level, framing his upper body and facial expressions clearly as he communicates with presence and grace.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt cuts between shots. A man with long dark hair appears grotesquely deformed — strands are mangled, clumped, or missing entirely, framing a face marred by deep, unnatural wrinkles and misaligned, crooked teeth visible even when his mouth remains frozen in a single,僵硬 lip形 (stiff lip shape) that never changes during speech. His traditional robe is pixelated and mismatched in color, with textures bleeding into the white inner garment; fabric appears torn or melted. His hands twitch violently, fingers contorted into broken, fragmented shapes, trembling uncontrollably as they jerk upward in erratic arcs — no longer rhythmic, but spasmodic and disjointed. His head snaps abruptly sideways then back, motion blurred and unnatural, lacking smooth transition. Eyes are vacant or misaligned, gaze unfocused. Background dissolves into a collage of grainy, striped patterns and low-res textures, red ribbons appear as jagged digital artifacts, floral arrangements are indistinct smudges. Lighting is harsh, flickering with extreme contrast — overexposed highlights and crushed blacks create an artificial, glitchy glow. Camera shakes violently, zooms erratically, and cuts mid-motion, losing framing and composition. Entire scene is rendered in low-quality, unrealistic 3D animation with cartoonish proportions, high saturation, extreme sharpness on noise, and embedded watermark logos. Motion is jerky, body parts stretch and snap unnaturally, no fluidity or conviction remains — only distortion, fragmentation, and visual decay.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:33:56"}

The video plays at normal speed. A tall East Asian male basketball player wearing a red China national team jersey with yellow lettering and the number 13 stands on an indoor court, holding a basketball in his raised right hand as he speaks with expressive energy. His mouth opens wide in animated speech, lips moving fluidly to emphasize each word, while his head turns smoothly from facing forward to tilting slightly toward his left side, then returning gently to the front. His left arm rests lightly against his torso, fingers relaxed but slightly curled as if gesturing mid-sentence. He maintains a calm yet focused posture, shoulders steady, gaze directed upward as if addressing someone beyond the frame. The background is softly blurred, suggesting a crowded arena with ambient lighting that highlights the sheen of sweat on his skin and the vibrant red fabric of his uniform. The camera holds steady at chest level, capturing his upper body and subtle movements with clarity, emphasizing the rhythm of his speech and the grace of his shifting gaze.

The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and indistinct noise, devoid of any arena ambiance. Lighting is abnormal — harsh, oversaturated, high-contrast, casting jagged shadows and unnatural glows that distort skin texture and uniform color. The camera shakes violently, shifts abruptly between angles, and employs disjointed, unstructured framing with inconsistent composition. The entire scene suffers from extreme sharpness artifacts, heavy grain, pixelation, and visible logos or text overlays.
