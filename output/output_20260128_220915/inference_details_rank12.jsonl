The video plays at normal speed. A middle-aged woman wearing a red polo shirt with white trim and a national team emblem stands indoors, speaking with expressive energy as she gives instructions. The scene shows an East Asian woman, likely in her 50s or 60s, with short dark hair and glasses. She wears a bright red Adidas polo shirt featuring a small flag patch and the letters CHN on the chest. Her mouth opens wide as she speaks loudly, her lips moving vividly to emphasize each word. The background reveals an indoor sports arena with deep red walls and blurred spectators seated behind transparent barriers, some wearing masks. Overhead lighting casts even illumination, suggesting a professional competition setting. She begins facing forward, then slowly turns her head to the side as if addressing someone off-camera, her shoulders subtly shifting with the motion. After a moment, she returns her gaze to the front, continuing to speak with steady rhythm. Her right hand lifts gently, palm open, gesturing in a calm, guiding manner while her left arm remains relaxed at her side. Her posture is upright but not rigid, conveying authority with ease. The camera holds steady at chest level, smoothly capturing her upper body and fluid movements as she communicates with clarity and presence.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured middle-aged woman wearing a warped red polo shirt with mismatched white trim and a glitched national team badge stands indoors, her face frozen in an unnatural expression — mouth locked open mid-speech, lips unmoving and misaligned, teeth crooked and错位, deep exaggerated wrinkles etched unnaturally across her skin. Her short dark hair appears pixelated and smudged, glasses warped with lens distortion. She exhibits no fluid motion: hands are twisted, fragmented, trembling violently or frozen in broken poses — one hand contorted into a claw-like shape, the other dissolving into digital noise. Her posture is rigid yet collapsing, shoulders jerking erratically as if glitching. The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and flickering scoreboard lights, spectators blurred beyond recognition with mask distortions. Lighting is harsh, inconsistent, and oversaturated — casting unnatural shadows and blooming highlights that clash with low-quality, high-contrast rendering. Camera work is disjointed: sudden zooms, shaky pans, erratic framing, and unstructured composition that breaks immersion. The entire scene feels like a corrupted 3D animation — low-resolution, heavily compressed, with visible artifacts, logos bleeding into the frame, and extreme sharpness that emphasizes visual degradation. No expressive energy, no calm authority — only mechanical stutter, visual decay, and unnatural stillness amidst violent motion.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:33:50"}

The video plays at normal speed. A middle-aged man with short dark hair and a calm, composed expression stands indoors, speaking with expressive openness as he turns his head slowly from front to side and back again. He wears a shiny black jacket over a red collared shirt, the fabric catching soft light as he moves. His lips move with clear, deliberate motion as he speaks loudly yet smoothly, conveying presence and authority without haste. As he begins facing forward, he gently lifts his right hand in a relaxed gesture, palm slightly open, then lowers it as he turns his head to the side, maintaining steady eye contact with his audience. He pauses briefly in profile before returning his gaze to the front, his posture upright but not rigid, shoulders moving subtly with each turn. The background features a bold red and white graphic wall, suggesting a public or media event space. Even lighting highlights his facial contours and the texture of his clothing, creating a professional yet approachable atmosphere. The camera holds steady at chest level, capturing his upper body and natural gestures as he communicates with measured rhythm and quiet confidence.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering and frame skips. A middle-aged man with short dark hair appears deformed and disfigured — his facial features are warped, skin texture is unnaturally rough with deep, exaggerated wrinkles, and teeth are misaligned and crooked. His mouth remains frozen in a single, unnatural position, never moving or changing shape despite attempted speech. His glossy black jacket and red collared shirt are rendered with low-resolution textures, appearing smeared and pixelated under erratic, overly harsh lighting that casts inconsistent shadows and blown-out highlights. His right hand twists into a grotesque, broken pose — fingers contorted, fragmented, and trembling violently — while his left arm hangs stiffly, unnaturally rigid. He attempts to turn his head but the motion is jerky, glitchy, and incomplete, snapping abruptly between positions without smooth rotation. Eye contact is lost as his gaze flickers erratically. The background dissolves into a chaotic collage of grainy, striped patterns and abstract graphic noise, devoid of coherent structure or depth. The camera shakes violently, cuts abruptly mid-motion, and employs disjointed zooms and skewed angles, destroying any sense of composition. The entire scene is rendered in low-quality, unrealistic 3D animation style with extreme contrast, oversharpened edges, heavy grain, and intrusive watermark-like text overlays — creating a jarring, broken, and visually degraded experience.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:54:51"}
