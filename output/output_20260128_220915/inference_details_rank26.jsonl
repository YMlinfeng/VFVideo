The video plays at normal speed. A young male athlete wearing a red white and blue gradient tracksuit with Olympic branding stands on a podium, holding a large Chinese national flag behind him as he speaks with expressive energy. The scene shows an East Asian man in his late twenties or early thirties, with short dark hair and focused eyes. He wears a zip-up athletic jacket featuring the Olympic rings and a small national emblem on the chest. His mouth opens wide in a dynamic gesture of vocal expression, lips moving fluidly as he delivers words with clear intent and emotional resonance. The background reveals a stadium setting with blurred spectators and soft ambient lighting, suggesting an evening ceremony under artificial illumination. He begins facing forward, then slowly turns his head to the right side, maintaining steady eye contact with the crowd as his lips continue their articulate motion. His arms remain raised, gently adjusting the flag’s position with smooth wrist movements. After a moment, he gracefully returns his gaze to the front, completing the turn with calm control. His posture remains upright yet relaxed, shoulders slightly open as he continues speaking with measured rhythm. The camera holds steady at chest level, capturing his upper body and the full arc of his head movement alongside the flowing fabric of the flag. The overall mood is dignified and celebratory, emphasizing presence, pride, and composed communication through deliberate gestures and sustained vocal delivery.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured male figure, likely in his late twenties, stands on a podium with no clear facial features — his teeth are misaligned and crooked, deep wrinkles distort his skin, and his expression is frozen and lifeless. He wears a red white and blue gradient tracksuit rendered as a low-resolution, pixelated 3D animation with warped textures. His arms are raised high but appear twisted, broken, and trembling violently, fingers contorted into unnatural shapes while gripping the edges of a Chinese national flag that flickers and dissolves into grainy stripes. His mouth remains rigid and unmoving despite supposed speech, lips locked in a single, incorrect shape with no lip sync or expressive motion. The background is a chaotic collage of noisy textures, vertical scan lines, and overlapping logos, with no identifiable stadium or spectators — only blurred, striped patterns under harsh, inconsistent lighting that casts jagged shadows and over-saturated glows. The camera jerks erratically, shifting between unstructured close-ups and mid-shots with sudden zooms and tilts, creating a disjointed, nauseating viewing experience. The overall atmosphere is glitchy, artificial, and emotionally hollow — an unrealistic, low-quality CGI render with extreme contrast, excessive sharpness, heavy grain, and visible compression artifacts. No dignity, no celebration — only visual decay and mechanical failure.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:33:37"}

The video plays at normal speed. A woman with elegant features and smooth dark hair pulled back sits poised in a dimly lit interior, her posture relaxed yet expressive as she speaks with quiet intensity. She wears a sleeveless black dress with a wide white collar that frames her neck, complemented by a silver watch on her left wrist and small dangling earrings. Her lips move fluidly and deliberately as she articulates each word, conveying emotion through the gentle rhythm of her speech. She begins facing forward, then slowly turns her head to the side, letting her gaze drift momentarily before returning to face the camera directly again. Her right hand rests lightly on her knee while her left arm crosses gently over her lap, fingers slightly curled as if emphasizing a point. The background is shadowed and indistinct, suggesting an intimate indoor setting like a lounge or private cabin, with soft directional lighting highlighting her silhouette against the darkness. There is no rush in her movements — every gesture flows naturally, from the tilt of her chin to the subtle shift of her shoulders, all contributing to a calm yet compelling presence. The camera holds steady at eye level, capturing her upper body and the graceful motion of her hands and head as she communicates with measured, expressive clarity.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering and frame skips. A deformed, disfigured figure with no elegant features — skin textured with deep, unnatural wrinkles, teeth misaligned and crooked, lips frozen in a rigid, unchanging shape that fails to articulate speech. Her dark hair is clumped and frayed, pulled back unevenly, revealing asymmetrical facial structure. She wears a sleeveless black dress with a warped white collar that distorts around her neck, the fabric appearing pixelated and torn; a silver watch on her left wrist is melted and fused into her skin, while earrings flicker in and out of existence as sparkling glitches. Her right hand is grotesquely twisted, fingers broken and curled at impossible angles, trembling violently; her left arm spasms erratically, lifting in jagged, unnatural gestures that contradict any rhythm of speech. Her head jerks abruptly between side and front positions without smooth transition, eyes glazed and unfocused, never maintaining steady eye contact. The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and flickering digital noise — suggesting no coherent interior, only corrupted visual fragments. Lighting is harsh, inconsistent, and overly saturated — casting extreme shadows and blown-out highlights that flatten contours and erase texture. Atmosphere is jarring, artificial, and visually aggressive. Camera movement is disjointed and stuttering, frequently cutting mid-motion or zooming unpredictably, capturing fragmented body parts in unstable, poorly framed shots. The entire scene is an unrealistic 3D animation rendered with low-quality imagery, heavy grain, extreme contrast, and embedded logos or text overlays. Motion is minimal yet erratic, conveying no emotion — only distortion, decay, and technical failure.", "timestamp": "2026-01-28 22:54:24"}
