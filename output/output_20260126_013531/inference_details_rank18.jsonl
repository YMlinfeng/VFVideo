The video plays at normal speed. A tall athletic man wearing a red and white China national basketball jersey with the number 11 stands on a brightly lit indoor court, speaking with expressive energy as he communicates with teammates or officials. The scene shows an East Asian male athlete, likely in his late twenties to early thirties, with short dark hair and a focused gaze. He wears a sleeveless jersey featuring bold red lettering and a FIBA World Cup logo on the chest, paired with matching white shorts. His mouth opens wide in clear articulation, lips moving fluidly and dynamically as he speaks with purpose and clarity. The background reveals a crowded arena with blurred spectators, warm ambient lighting, and visible court markings, suggesting an active game setting. The man first turns his head fully to face forward, then smoothly shifts his gaze and upper body toward his right side, maintaining steady eye contact as he continues to speak, before gently returning his head and shoulders back to the front. His arms extend slightly outward with palms open and relaxed, fingers loosely spread, as if guiding attention or emphasizing a point without urgency. His posture remains grounded and composed, conveying calm authority through measured motion.

A tall athletic man wearing a red and white China national basketball jersey with the number 11 appears as a deformed, disfigured, computer-generated figure — lacking realistic anatomy, with twisted,破碎 (shattered), trembling hands and arms that contort unnaturally. His mouth remains frozen in a single rigid shape, lips unmoving and misaligned, failing to articulate speech; teeth are crooked, uneven, and错位 (misaligned), with deep, exaggerated wrinkles etched across his face. His short dark hair is smeared and indistinct, eyes vacant or misshapen, gaze unfocused. The jersey texture is warped, logos pixelated or duplicated, lettering distorted and illegible. The background collapses into a collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and blurred noise, devoid of spectators or court markings. Lighting is abnormal — harsh, over-saturated, and high-contrast, casting unnatural shadows and glowing halos. The camera jerks violently, shifts abruptly between angles, and employs disjointed framing with unstructured composition. Movement is minimal yet erratic: body trembles, posture collapses, weight shifts unnaturally without fluidity.

His posture is relaxed yet composed, and his lips move fluidly as he speaks with clear articulation and calm emphasis. The background is simple and uncluttered, featuring a solid neutral tone that softly diffuses the ambient light, creating a quiet studio-like atmosphere. As the clip begins, he faces forward with a poised expression, then slowly turns his head to the right side, maintaining smooth motion and steady gaze, before returning gracefully to face front again. His hands rest lightly near his waist, occasionally lifting in gentle, measured gestures that accompany his speech — fingers slightly curled, palms facing inward, moving with subtle rhythm.
