The video plays at normal speed. A young male athlete wearing a red white and blue gradient tracksuit with Olympic branding stands on a podium, holding a large Chinese national flag behind him as he speaks with expressive energy. The scene shows an East Asian man in his late twenties or early thirties, with short dark hair and focused eyes. He wears a zip-up athletic jacket featuring the Olympic rings and a small national emblem on the chest. His mouth opens wide in a dynamic gesture of vocal expression, lips moving fluidly as he delivers words with clear intent and emotional resonance. The background reveals a stadium setting with blurred spectators and soft ambient lighting, suggesting an evening ceremony under artificial illumination. He begins facing forward, then slowly turns his head to the right side, maintaining steady eye contact with the crowd as his lips continue their articulate motion. His arms remain raised, gently adjusting the flag’s position with smooth wrist movements. After a moment, he gracefully returns his gaze to the front, completing the turn with calm control. His posture remains upright yet relaxed, shoulders slightly open as he continues speaking with measured rhythm. The camera holds steady at chest level, capturing his upper body and the full arc of his head movement alongside the flowing fabric of the flag. The overall mood is dignified and celebratory, emphasizing presence, pride, and composed communication through deliberate gestures and sustained vocal delivery.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured male figure, likely in his late twenties, stands on a podium with no clear facial features — his teeth are misaligned and crooked, deep wrinkles distort his skin, and his expression is frozen and lifeless. He wears a red white and blue gradient tracksuit rendered as a low-resolution, pixelated 3D animation with warped textures. His arms are raised high but appear twisted, broken, and trembling violently, fingers contorted into unnatural shapes while gripping the edges of a Chinese national flag that flickers and dissolves into grainy stripes. His mouth remains rigid and unmoving despite supposed speech, lips locked in a single, incorrect shape with no lip sync or expressive motion. The background is a chaotic collage of noisy textures, vertical scan lines, and overlapping logos, with no identifiable stadium or spectators — only blurred, striped patterns under harsh, inconsistent lighting that casts jagged shadows and over-saturated glows. The camera jerks erratically, shifting between unstructured close-ups and mid-shots with sudden zooms and tilts, creating a disjointed, nauseating viewing experience. The overall atmosphere is glitchy, artificial, and emotionally hollow — an unrealistic, low-quality CGI render with extreme contrast, excessive sharpness, heavy grain, and visible compression artifacts. No dignity, no celebration — only visual decay and mechanical failure.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:39"}
