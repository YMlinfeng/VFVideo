The video plays at normal speed. A young woman with wavy dark brown hair styled loosely around her shoulders sits elegantly beside a glossy black display case, wearing a strapless black gown and delicate leaf-shaped jewelry that catches the light. Her expression is poised yet expressive as she begins to speak with gentle animation, her lips moving fluidly to convey emotion without haste. She starts by turning her head fully toward the camera, facing forward with calm confidence, then smoothly shifts her gaze to the side, allowing her profile to be seen in soft silhouette against the dim background, before gracefully returning her face to the front once more. Her right hand rests lightly on the glass surface, fingers slightly curled as if brushing over an unseen object, while her left hand gently supports her chin, subtly adjusting its position as she speaks. The ambient lighting is low and warm, highlighting her features against a blurred backdrop of dark tones and faint floral patterns, suggesting an upscale indoor setting like a gallery or private event space. Her movements are unhurried and deliberate, conveying quiet charisma and thoughtful presence. The camera holds steady at eye level, capturing her upper body and nuanced gestures as she communicates with soft emphasis and composed grace.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt scene cuts. A young woman with wavy dark brown hair appears grotesquely deformed — strands are broken, clumped, or floating unnaturally, lacking volume or texture. Her face is disfigured: teeth misaligned and jagged, deep unnatural wrinkles carved across her cheeks and forehead, eyes sunken or asymmetrical, lips frozen in a rigid, incorrect shape that never moves despite attempted speech. Her skin is overly saturated with harsh contrast, appearing plastic-like with pixelated grain and artificial sharpness.\n\nShe wears a warped black strapless dress that stretches and tears at the seams, textures glitching as if rendered by low-poly 3D software. Her leaf-shaped jewelry is malformed — edges jagged, surfaces fractured, glimmer replaced by flickering noise. Her right hand is twisted, fingers contorted into impossible angles, trembling violently while scraping erratically across a glossy black surface now marred with scratches and digital artifacts. Her left arm collapses under her chin, elbow bent unnaturally, wrist snapping mid-motion, fingers twitching like broken puppets.\n\nHer head jerks abruptly between positions — forward, side, back — with no smooth transition, each turn accompanied by frame skips and motion blur. Her shoulders twitch spasmodically, posture collapsing into hunched deformity. No warmth or presence remains — only mechanical, glitched mimicry of expression.\n\nThe background is a chaotic collage of grainy static, striped patterns, and corrupted floral motifs, bleeding into each other with no depth or cohesion. The red rose with silver leaves near her fingertips is melted, pixelated, or duplicated across the frame, sometimes replaced by floating logos or unreadable text. Lighting is hyper-artificial — extreme high contrast creates blown-out highlights and crushed shadows, casting jagged halos around her form. No ambient serenity — only visual noise and aggressive sharpness.\n\nThe camera lurches unpredictably — zooms snap in and out, pans stutter sideways, tilts erratically, framing her inconsistently with half-cut limbs and skewed perspective. Composition is unstructured, often cutting off her head or hands, emphasizing the glitchy, low-quality animation style. Every movement is erratic, every detail degraded — an uncanny, broken simulation of grace, frozen in digital decay.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:21"}
