The video plays at normal speed. A man in a dark pinstripe suit stands indoors, speaking with expressive energy as he addresses the audience. He holds a microphone close to his mouth, his lips moving vividly as he articulates each word with clear emphasis. His head begins facing forward, then turns smoothly to the side as if engaging someone off-camera, before returning gently to the front, maintaining a calm and composed presence throughout. His right hand grips the microphone steadily while his left hand rests lightly on his hip, occasionally shifting in a relaxed manner to complement his speech. He has short, neatly styled dark hair and wears a black inner shirt beneath his tailored blazer. The background is a plain white wall featuring promotional text for “Gone With The Light” dated December 13, 2019. Soft, even lighting illuminates the scene, creating a professional yet approachable atmosphere typical of a press event or public appearance. His posture remains upright but not rigid, allowing subtle shifts in weight and shoulder position that enhance the natural flow of his delivery. The camera stays fixed at chest level, capturing his upper body and fluid gestures as he communicates with warmth and clarity.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, suffering from severe stuttering and abrupt cuts between shots. A deformed, disfigured figure stands indoors — an abstract, computer-generated, unrealistic 3D animation with cartoonish, low-poly textures and no coherent human features. His face is grotesquely warped: mouth frozen mid-expression with mismatched, crooked teeth jutting out at odd angles, deep unnatural wrinkles etched across his skin like cracked porcelain. Eyes are misaligned or missing, hair rendered as jagged, static clumps. He wears a pinstripe suit that appears melted and pixelated, fabric texture broken into glitchy shards. His hands are twisted, elongated, and trembling violently — fingers fused or fragmented, microphone dissolving into digital noise as he grips it. Left hand hovers unnaturally near hip, twitching erratically without purpose. Head snaps violently left and right in jerky, non-fluid motions — no smooth eye contact, gaze vacant or glitching off-screen. Shoulders jerk unnaturally with each spasm, lacking rhythm or grace. Background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, vertical stripes, and corrupted promotional text reading “Gone With The Light” and “2019.12.13” — letters flickering, overlapping, or half-erased. Lighting is harsh and inconsistent: overexposed highlights bleach parts of his face while others drown in deep, muddy shadows; reflections appear smeared and artificial. Camera shakes violently, zooms unpredictably, and cuts abruptly mid-motion — framing constantly off-center, composition unstructured and disorienting. Entire scene suffers from extreme contrast, oversharpened edges, heavy grain, compression artifacts, and floating logos. No warmth, no confidence — only visual decay, mechanical distortion, and unnatural motion.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:22"}
