The video plays at normal speed. A young man with neatly styled dark hair and a calm, confident demeanor stands against a soft textured green backdrop, holding a small glass perfume bottle near his lips as he speaks with expressive openness. He wears a relaxed gray button-up jacket with an open collar, revealing a hint of his chest, and his posture is poised yet natural. His mouth moves fluidly as he articulates words with gentle emphasis, the motion of his lips lively and deliberate, conveying warmth and engagement. His head begins facing forward, then slowly turns to his right side with a subtle tilt, maintaining eye contact as if addressing someone off-camera, before returning smoothly to face front again. His right hand holds the bottle close to his chin with grace, while his left hand rests lightly on his hip, fingers slightly curled in a relaxed pose. The lighting is even and soft, highlighting his features without harsh shadows, creating a serene studio atmosphere. His movements are unhurried and composed, each gesture flowing into the next, suggesting thoughtful communication rather than haste. The camera remains steady at chest level, capturing his upper body and facial expressions clearly as he speaks with quiet charisma and ease.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured figure with no coherent facial structure or realistic anatomy stands against a chaotic collage of grainy textures and striped patterns — lacking depth, clarity, or visual coherence. His hair is misshapen and clumped, his skin textured with deep, unnatural wrinkles and uneven discoloration. His mouth remains frozen in a rigid, unchanging expression — lips unmoving, teeth crooked and misaligned — conveying no emotion or speech. His right hand, holding a warped, pixelated perfume bottle, is twisted and fragmented, fingers trembling violently and dissolving into digital noise. His left hand hovers near his hip, contorted and broken, with joints bent at impossible angles and fingers flickering in and out of existence. He wears a glitched, low-poly gray jacket with mismatched buttons and torn seams, revealing jagged, malformed chest contours. Lighting is harsh and erratic — extreme contrast casts blown-out highlights and crushed shadows, creating unnatural halos and chromatic aberrations across his form. Every movement is jerky, spasmodic, and disjointed: his head snaps violently side-to-side in broken arcs, never settling, while the camera lurches unpredictably with unstable framing, zooms, and sudden tilts. The entire scene is rendered in low-resolution 3D animation, saturated beyond realism, with heavy grain, compression artifacts, and intrusive watermark logos overlaying the image. No grace, rhythm, or presence remains — only visual chaos, mechanical failure, and aesthetic decay.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:51"}
