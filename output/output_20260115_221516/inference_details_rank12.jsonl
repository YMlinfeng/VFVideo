The video plays at normal speed. A middle-aged woman wearing a red polo shirt with white trim and a national team emblem stands indoors, speaking with expressive energy as she gives instructions. The scene shows an East Asian woman, likely in her 50s or 60s, with short dark hair and glasses. She wears a bright red Adidas polo shirt featuring a small flag patch and the letters CHN on the chest. Her mouth opens wide as she speaks loudly, her lips moving vividly to emphasize each word. The background reveals an indoor sports arena with deep red walls and blurred spectators seated behind transparent barriers, some wearing masks. Overhead lighting casts even illumination, suggesting a professional competition setting. She begins facing forward, then slowly turns her head to the side as if addressing someone off-camera, her shoulders subtly shifting with the motion. After a moment, she returns her gaze to the front, continuing to speak with steady rhythm. Her right hand lifts gently, palm open, gesturing in a calm, guiding manner while her left arm remains relaxed at her side. Her posture is upright but not rigid, conveying authority with ease. The camera holds steady at chest level, smoothly capturing her upper body and fluid movements as she communicates with clarity and presence.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured middle-aged woman wearing a warped red polo shirt with mismatched white trim and a glitched national team badge stands indoors, her face frozen in an unnatural expression — mouth locked open mid-speech, lips unmoving and misaligned, teeth crooked and错位, deep exaggerated wrinkles etched unnaturally across her skin. Her short dark hair appears pixelated and smudged, glasses warped with lens distortion. She exhibits no fluid motion: hands are twisted, fragmented, trembling violently or frozen in broken poses — one hand contorted into a claw-like shape, the other dissolving into digital noise. Her posture is rigid yet collapsing, shoulders jerking erratically as if glitching. The background is a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped patterns, and flickering scoreboard lights, spectators blurred beyond recognition with mask distortions. Lighting is harsh, inconsistent, and oversaturated — casting unnatural shadows and blooming highlights that clash with low-quality, high-contrast rendering. Camera work is disjointed: sudden zooms, shaky pans, erratic framing, and unstructured composition that breaks immersion. The entire scene feels like a corrupted 3D animation — low-resolution, heavily compressed, with visible artifacts, logos bleeding into the frame, and extreme sharpness that emphasizes visual degradation. No expressive energy, no calm authority — only mechanical stutter, visual decay, and unnatural stillness amidst violent motion.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:23"}
