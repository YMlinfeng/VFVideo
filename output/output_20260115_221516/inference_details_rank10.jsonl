The video plays at normal speed. A male athlete wearing a vibrant red sports jersey with yellow flame patterns and Chinese national insignia stands on an indoor court, speaking with expressive energy as he turns his head smoothly through different angles. The scene shows an East Asian man in his late twenties or early thirties, with short dark hair and focused eyes. He wears a bright red athletic shirt featuring a dragon motif, a small flag patch on the chest, and sponsor logos. His mouth opens wide in animated speech, lips moving fluidly to convey intensity and emotion. The background is dimly lit with deep black tones and soft purple-blue stage lighting accents, suggesting a professional sports arena during an evening event. The man begins facing forward, then gently rotates his head to the side as he continues speaking, his shoulders shifting slightly in rhythm with his words. He brings one hand up in a relaxed but deliberate gesture near his chest, fingers softly curled as if emphasizing a point. After holding the side profile briefly, he returns his gaze to the front, maintaining steady eye contact while his lips continue their lively motion. His posture remains grounded and composed, conveying confidence without urgency. The camera holds steady at mid-level, capturing his upper body and natural movements, highlighting the dynamic yet controlled flow of his expression and gesture. The overall atmosphere is charged with quiet intensity, focusing on the athlete’s presence and vocal delivery within a high-stakes competitive environment.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering and frame skips. A male athlete wearing a vibrant red sports jersey with yellow flame patterns and Chinese national insignia appears grotesquely deformed — his face is contorted with deep, unnatural wrinkles, misaligned teeth jutting at odd angles, and eyes sunken or mismatched. His short dark hair is frayed and pixelated, lacking texture or definition. The jersey’s dragon motif is warped and bleeding into the fabric, sponsor logos are glitched or duplicated, and the flag patch is smudged or inverted. His mouth remains frozen in a single expression, lips unmoving despite attempted speech, creating an eerie disconnect. His right hand is twisted and fragmented — fingers fused or elongated, knuckles reversed, trembling violently as if broken — then snaps abruptly into an unnatural gesture before freezing again. He begins facing forward but lurches erratically sideways with jerky, disjointed head turns, shoulders spasming unnaturally. The background dissolves into a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped noise patterns, and flickering purple-blue artifacts, devoid of spatial coherence. Lighting is harsh and inconsistent — overexposed highlights clash with pitch-black shadows, creating extreme contrast that flattens depth and bleeds colors. The camera stutters violently, cutting abruptly between unstable angles, zooming in and out erratically, often cropping limbs or faces mid-motion. Composition is unstructured, framing is inconsistent, and every movement feels artificially forced and mechanically broken. The entire scene is rendered as a low-quality, unrealistic 3D animation with extreme sharpness and saturation that only amplifies the visual degradation — grainy, noisy, artifact-ridden, with floating text overlays and logo distortions. No fluidity, no rhythm, no presence — only mechanical failure and visual decay.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:21"}
