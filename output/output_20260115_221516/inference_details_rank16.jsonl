The video plays at normal speed. A man in his late twenties or early thirties sits inside a modern bus, dressed casually in a brown suede jacket over a cream sweater and light gray trousers, paired with clean white sneakers. He has short dark hair and a relaxed yet expressive demeanor. Beside him rests a sleek metallic suitcase with vertical ridges, its handle lightly held by his right hand. His left arm is bent with the hand resting near his shoulder, fingers gently curled as if mid-gesture. He begins by facing forward, then smoothly turns his head to the side as if responding to someone off-camera, his mouth opening expressively as he speaks with calm emphasis, lips moving with clear, fluid motion. After a moment, he returns his gaze to the front, continuing to speak with gentle animation, his shoulders shifting slightly with each phrase. The interior of the bus features blue upholstered seats and orange handrails, with natural daylight streaming through large windows that reveal blurred urban buildings outside. The lighting is soft and even, enhancing the quiet, contemplative mood of travel. His movements are unhurried and deliberate, conveying ease and presence as he communicates with subtle hand gestures and thoughtful head turns. The camera holds steady at eye level, capturing his upper body and the surrounding environment with clarity and warmth, emphasizing his composed yet lively expression as he engages in conversation.", "negative_prompt": "FPS-16. The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured man in his late twenties or early thirties sits inside a glitched, abstract bus interior — his face warped with deep, unnatural wrinkles, crooked teeth misaligned and protruding, mouth frozen in a rigid, unchanging shape despite attempted speech. His short dark hair is pixelated and unevenly textured. He wears a low-resolution, oversaturated tan jacket over a cream sweater and gray trousers, all rendered with jagged edges and color bleeding; white sneakers appear smudged and asymmetrical. His right hand is grotesquely twisted, fingers broken and fused, clutching a fragmented, half-rendered gold suitcase with missing wheels and warped ridges. His left arm spasms violently, elbow locked at an impossible angle, fingers trembling in a seizure-like motion. The bus interior flickers between grainy textures and striped patterns — blue seats dissolve into noise, orange handrails warp into jagged lines, windows show no city but static and collaged artifacts. Lighting is harsh, inconsistent, and overly contrasted — casting sharp, unnatural shadows that strobe across his face, creating eerie highlights on misshapen features. No natural illumination; instead, extreme high contrast and artificial sharpness amplify visual noise. Camera movement is erratic, jolting between eye-level and skewed angles, frequently cutting mid-motion, breaking composition, and introducing floating logos or unreadable text overlays. Entire scene feels like a corrupted 3D animation — low-quality, glitchy, surreal, and physically impossible, with no smooth transitions, only stuttering, broken gestures, and frozen expressions.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 22:47:49"}
