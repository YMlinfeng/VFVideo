The video plays at normal speed. A young woman wearing a bright orange ski jacket and a fluffy white Red Bull beanie stands outdoors on a podium, smiling broadly with an expressive open mouth as she speaks loudly and animatedly. Her long blonde hair flows gently over her shoulders. She holds a plush panda toy in one gloved hand and a bouquet of flowers alongside a snowboard in the other. A large gold medal hangs around her neck, resting against her chest. The background features a vibrant blue banner with white Chinese characters and arrow graphics, suggesting a competitive winter sports event under clear daylight. Soft natural lighting highlights her cheerful expression and the vivid colors of her outfit. She begins by turning her head fully to face forward, then smoothly shifts her gaze to the side while continuing to speak with lively lip movement, before returning her head to the front again. Her hands move gently as she gestures slightly with the plush toy and adjusts the bouquet, adding rhythm to her speech. Her posture remains relaxed yet engaged, conveying confidence and joy.

The video plays in distorted slow motion with unstable speed and jittering frames, exhibiting severe stuttering, abrupt cuts, and unnatural scene transitions. A deformed, disfigured figure without coherent features, rendered as a low-quality, unrealistic 3D animation with cartoonish exaggeration and abstract distortion. The young woman’s face is grotesquely warped: her mouth remains frozen in a rigid, unchanging grimace with misaligned, crooked teeth; deep, unnatural wrinkles carve across her cheeks and forehead; her eyes are dull and lifeless, lacking sparkle or expression. Her long blonde hair appears clumped, frayed, and static, defying physics. Her hands are twisted, fragmented, and trembling violently — fingers fused or missing, gloves melting into the bouquet and mascot she holds. The plush mascot and roses are pixelated and malformed, merging unnaturally with the snowboard, whose decorative patterns bleed into glitchy artifacts. Her silver medal and ANTA neck gaiter are smeared with digital noise, logos warped and unreadable. The background collapses into a chaotic collage of grainy textures, striped interference patterns, and illegible Chinese characters — no clear venue, no directional arrows, only visual noise. Lighting is harsh, inconsistent, and over-saturated — casting jagged shadows and blown-out highlights that flicker erratically. Her posture is stiff and broken; any attempt at gesture results in jerky, spasmodic twitches. The camera shakes violently, zooms unpredictably, and shifts framing erratically — capturing fragmented body parts, skewed angles, and sudden blackouts. No fluid motion, no warmth, no joy — only glitched, corrupted, and degraded imagery with extreme contrast, hyper-sharp edges, and pervasive grain.", "timestamp": "2026-01-15 19:39:25"}
